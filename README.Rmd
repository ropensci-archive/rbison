Wrapper for the USGS Bison API.

## Description

USGS Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) is a web-based federal mapping resource that provides access to georeferenced (those with latitude and longitude coordinates) and non-georeferenced data describing the occurrence or presence of terrestrial and aquatic species recorded or collected by a person (or instrument) at a specific time in the United States and its Territories. Each record in a species occurrence dataset available in BISON will typically consist of a scientific name (genus and specific epithet), a date, and one or more geographic references such as a state name, county name, and/or decimal latitude and longitude coordinates. In addition to these typical data fields, species occurrence datasets often include many other data fields that describe each species occurrence event in more detail.

rbison allows one to pull species occurrence data from these datasets, inspect species occurance summaries, and then map species occurance within the US, within the contiguous 48 states, and/or at county or state level. The species are listed alphabetically by scientific name and each name links to a dynamically generated map of occurrences for that species.

Current data providers for BISON can be found at https://bison.usgs.gov/#providers.

See <https://bison.usgs.gov/#api> for API docs for the BISON API.

## Installation

From CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rbison")
```

Or the development version from Github

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rbison")
library('rbison')
```

Load package

```{r}
library("rbison")
```

Notice that the function `bisonmap` automagically selects the map extent to plot for you, being one of the contiguous lower 48 states, or the lower 48 plus AK and HI, or a global map. If some or all points outside the US, a global map is drawn, and throws a warning. . You may want to make sure the occurrence lat/long coordinates are correct.

## get data

```{r}
out <- bison(species = "Phocoenoides dalli dalli", count = 10)
```


### inspect summary

```{r}
out$summary
```

### map occurrences

```{r}
bisonmap(out)
```

## All points within the US (including AK and HI)

### get data

```{r}
out <- bison(species = "Bison bison", count = 600)
```


### inspect summary

```{r}
out$summary
```

### map occurrences

```{r}
bisonmap(out)
```

##  All points within the contiguous 48 states

### get data

```{r cache=TRUE}
out <- bison(species = "Aquila chrysaetos", count = 600)
```


### inspect summary

```{r}
out$summary
```


### map occurrences

```{r}
bisonmap(out)
```


## Map county or state level data

### Counties - using last data call for Aquila

```{r}
bisonmap(out, tomap = "county")
```

### States - using last data call for Aquila

```{r}
bisonmap(out, tomap = "state")
```


## BISON SOLR interface

### taxa

The taxa service searches for and gives back taxonomic names

```{r}
bison_tax(query = "*bear")
```

And you can search by scientific name

```{r}
bison_tax(query = "Helianthus*", method = "scientificName")
```

### occurrence search

The occurrence service searches by scientific names and gives back occurrence 
data similar to data given back by the `bison()` function

Searching for data and looking at output

```{r}
bison_solr(scientificName = "Ursus americanus", state_code = "New Mexico", rows = 50, fl = "eventDate,scientificName")
```

Mapping the data

```{r}
out <- bison_solr(scientificName = "Ursus americanus", rows = 200)
bisonmap(out)
```
